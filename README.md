WIDesigner is a Java application to assist the design of woodwind instruments.
In its current version, it calculates instrument dimensions to provide optimum tuning accuracy
over the range of an instrument.
With version 2.0.0, WIDesigner supports fipple flutes, transverse flutes, single-reed and double-reed instruments,
and a limited set of lip-reed instruments.
