## WIDesigner
Woodwind Instrument Designer

WIDesigner is a Java application to assist the design of woodwind instruments.
In its current version, it calculates instrument dimensions to provide optimum tuning accuracy
over the range of an instrument.
With version 2.0.0, WIDesigner supports fipple flutes, transverse flutes, single-reed and double-reed instruments,
and a limited set of lip-reed instruments.

[Using WIDesigner](https://github.com/edwardkort/WWIDesigner/wiki/Using-WIDesigner) describes
the current instantiation of the application, and summarizes how to use it. 
See the [latest release page](https://github.com/edwardkort/WWIDesigner/releases/latest)
to download the most recent WIDesigner release, with associated libraries and sample files.

The transverse flute model requires more data from real flutes for proper calibration.
Unfortunately, none of the current contributors has the flute skills to collect this data.
Flute players interested in assisting are asked to contact one of the contributors.
