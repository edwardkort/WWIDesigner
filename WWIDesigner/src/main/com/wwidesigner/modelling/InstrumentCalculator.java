/**
 * Calculates attributes of the instrument body as seen by the driving source.<br/>
 * 
 * For flow-node mouthpieces (flutes and fipple flutes):<br/>
 * 
 * - calcZ() returns impedance seen by driving source.  Expect resonance
 *   when imaginary part is zero or phase angle is zero.<br/>
 * 
 * - calcReflectionCoefficient() returns coefficient of pressure reflection
 *   seen by driving source.  Expect resonance when coefficient is -1
 *   or phase angle is pi.<br/>
 *
 * For pressure-node mouthpieces (cane reeds, lip reeds, brass):<br/>
 * 
 * - calcZ() returns normalized admittance seen by driving source: Z0/Z.
 *   Expect resonance when imaginary part is zero or phase angle is zero.<br/>
 * 
 * - calcReflectionCoefficient() returns negative coefficient of pressure
 *   reflection (coefficient of flow reflection) seen by driving source.
 *   Expect resonance when coefficient is -1 or phase angle is pi.<br/>
